Introduction
------------

The :mod:`xdrlib2` package offers an implementation of the `XDR` protocol,
as defined in :rfc:`4506`.
It offers:

    #. An executable `xdrc` that can be used to compile an `XDR` specification
       into a corresponding Python module.
    #. A complete set of `XDR` classes, both concrete and abstract.
       The `xdrc` tool uses these classes in the Python module it creates.
    #. A set of tools that allows the creation of variants of the `XDR` protocol.
